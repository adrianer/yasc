configure the project
---------------------

1. With Ubuntu you need these packages:

python
python-pygame
python-opengl

2. For rendering textures and game-objects you further need the newest Blender-version
(currently 2.56a [beta]). Download a matching binary-package for your machine
from http://www.blender.org/ , extract to a directory of your choice, and customize the BLENDER
variable in the "Makefile" so that it points to the actual program-file of your new Blender-version.

3. Now do "make" in the project root directory, this does: Rendering, Gfx-Postprocessing,
C-Compiling and Python-Compiling.

4. Start game with "bash launch.sh"

5. "make clean" deletes some auto-generated files (by "make"), except the Renderings and docs.

6. "make totalclean" deletes all auto-generated files, really all!!!

build an epydoc reference
-------------------------

1. With Ubuntu you need the package:

python-epydoc

2. From the project's root directory do "make epydoc".

3. Now view the reference of the project's python code by opening doc/pysrc/index.html
in your web browser.
