configure the project
---------------------

1. with Ubuntu you need these packages:

libsdl1.2-dev
libsdl-image1.2-dev
python

2. for rendering textures and game-objects you further need the newest Blender-version
(currently 2.56a [beta]). Download a matching binary-package for your machine
from http://www.blender.org/ , extract to a directory of your choice, and customize the BLENDER
variable in the "Makefile" so that it points to the actual program-file of your new blender-version.

3. now do "make" in the project root directory, this does: Rendering, Gfx-Postprocessing,
C-Compiling and Python-compiling.

4. start game with "bash launch.sh"

5. "make clean" deletes all auto-generated files (by "make"), except the renderings.

6. "make totalclean" deletes all auto-generated files (by "make"), really all!!!
